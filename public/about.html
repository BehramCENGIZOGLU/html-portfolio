<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I have mostly worked as a full-stack developer in web applications, but I am
  also striving to improve myself in different areas and gain diverse
  experiences. I would describe myself as an entrepreneurial, honest, determined
  person who enjoys researching, is open to learning, and works well in a team
  environment. I share the personal projects I develop on my GitHub page. I
  completed my one-year compulsory military service as a Reserve Officer between
  May 2024 and May 2025.
